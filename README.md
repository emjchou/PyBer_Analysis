# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this new analysis is to create a summary for the ride-sharing data based ont he type of each city. Using this data, a line graph which shows data for each city can be created and analyzed.

## Results
Based on the ride-sharing data summary that we created, the following is concluded:
Rural City type:
	125 Total Rides
	537 Total Drivers
	$4327.93 Total Fares
	$34.62 Average Fare per Ride
	$8.06 Average Fare per Driver
Surburban City Type:
	625 Total Rides
	8,570 Total Drivers
	$19,356.33 Total Fares
	$30,97 Average Fare per Ride
	$2.26 Average Fare per Driver
Urban City type:
	1,625 Total Rides
	59,602 Total Drivers
	$39,854.38 Total Fares
	$24.53 Average Fare per Ride
	$0.67 Average Fare per Driver

In observing the data above, it can be seen that rural cities make the least total fares, have the least total rides, and the least total drivers. Despite this, the Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.
In contrast, the Urban cities have the highest total fares, total rides, and total drivers, but the lowest average fare per ride and lowest average fare per driver.
Thus, there can be a reasonable conclusion that the total rides is conversely proportional to the average fares. 

In creating the multiple-line graph, the total weekly fares for each city type can be visualized, as shown below:

In viewing the graph above, the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types can be seen:

The Rural graph line is quite steady, with many small spikes and dips.
The Surburban graph line varies much more. Some weeks are quite high and some quite low.
The Urban graph line shows a steady increase and then spiking decreases. 

In viewing all of these together, it can be seen that all graph lines (i.e. each city type) experienced an increase and then a sharp drop right before, and on the first week of march. 

## Summary
In summary, the three following recommendations can be made:

1. Minimize the average fare per rider
2. Maximize the average fare per driver
3. Don't need as many drivers since there are more drivers than total rides.
